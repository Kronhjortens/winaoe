Mini howto for making winaoe under Windows 7 with a
Linux AoE target work. If you have questions or want
to contribute contact Johannes Thoma
<johannes@johannesthoma.com>

The original winaoe driver is still availalbe at
http://winaoe.org . I've just added a small patch
to make it work with vblade (Linux) as well as
patches for making it compile with 2019's mingw
that comes with cygwin.

# Install aoetools (client/AoE initiator) for Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install aoetools

# Get vblade user space server (AoE target)
git clone https://github.com/OpenAoE/vblade.git

# build and install vblade
cd vblade
make
sudo make install

# Windows partition manager playground
sudo vblade 0 1 enp0s8 /dev/sdd9

# formerly
sudo vblade 0 1 enp0s8 /dev/sdb1

# loopback test
sudo vblade 0 1 lo /dev/sdb1
aoe-discover
aoe-stat
ls /dev/etherd/e0.1

# on Windows
Open cmd shell as administrator
cd into aoe/bin directory

loader64

reboot (it will say so)

Then after reboot following should work:

aoe scan
	should report targets
aoe mount <client-MAC> <major> <minor>
	to mount disk (will show up in partition manager)
	client MAC is the MAC for the Windows host (use
	ipconfig /all to display)

When successful there should be a Installing drivers for
new hardware pop up once.

# building winaoe with MinGW for 64-bit Windows

You need:

cygwin with mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core, mingw64-x86_64-gcc-headers installed
(plus make) (also runtime?)

for now there are patches needed to the mingw headers (sorry
for that). TODO: provide patch files.

Unfortunately for signtool you also need the Ewdk from Microsoft.

Edit Makefile for your Ewdk installation (defaults to C:\Ewdk)

The rest is easy:

make

should generate the aoe64.sys loader64.exe aoe.exe and aoe.inf files.

To compile for a 32-bit target do

make -f Makefile.32

(do a make clean if you have built for 64 bit before)

----

Debugging with Windows:

Install WinDbg
Start it and select:
	Capture Kernel
	Kernel Verbose Output

You should see the DbgPrint output (try aoe scan it will print something)

----

Known bugs:

Currently sizes are reported as 0. 

Partition manager claims that the drive is write-protected (however
this might be because of the size bug).
